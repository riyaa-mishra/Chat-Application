This project is a full-stack, realtime chat application similar to basic versions of Slack or Discord. Users can:

Join a chat room by entering their name and a room name.

Send and receive messages instantly with all other users in the same room.

See a live list of all users currently in the room.

Exchange messages, including emojis and links (which become clickable).

The core challenge it solves is synchronizing data between multiple clients instantly, which is achieved using WebSockets.
